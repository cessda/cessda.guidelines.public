# CESSDA Quality Requirements

CESSDA requires its tools and services to be of sufficient quality for sustainable operation.

The quality and acceptability of CESSDA tools and services is measured through the [CESSDA Software Maturity Levels](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2614050).

For a service to be operated by CESSDA, the following criteria must be met

* All applicable CAs must be met at "Expected"
* The relevant programing language's style guide must be followed and enforced through linting
* unit testing coverage must be at 80% or above

For a service to be considered for future integration, all Maturity Levels' CAs must reach "Minimum".
