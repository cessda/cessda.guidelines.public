# CESSDA Technical Reference Implementation

This repository contains CESSDA's implementation of the [EURISE Network Technical Reference](https://technical-reference.readthedocs.io/en/v0.1/).

## Getting started

Assuming you have python installed, create a virtual env

```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

With activated venv, i.e. the source command above, compile with

```
make clean
make html
```
