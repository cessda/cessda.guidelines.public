## Purpose

Provide guidance for CESSDA Content Contacts,
so they know what is expected of them with respect to producing end user documentation.

It should be read in conjunction with the
[CESSDA Technical Guidelines](https://docs.tech.cessda.eu), in particular the SML requirement
[CA1.1](https://docs.tech.cessda.eu/sml/ca1-documentation.html#ca11-end-user-documentation).

## User manual

### General requirements

- Ensure that the content is directly related to the current version of the product

- Clearly state the version number of the documentation, which should match the current version of the product

- Optionally add a date (month and year is sufficient)

- State the license of the content of the documentation
    (use [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)
    unless there is a very good reason not to)

- Include a glossary and define any abbreviations and specialised terms.

### Specific requirements

- Explain the use of the principal features (as defined by the Use Cases/User Stories)

- Explain any customisations that are available
    (settings, options etc that the End User can change or select so that they have a personalised experience).
