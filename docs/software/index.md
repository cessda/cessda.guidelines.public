# CESSDA Software Development

Development of CESSDA tools and services is carried out using CESSDA-owned git-repositories on Bitbucket.

If the code is developed publicly elsewhere, mirroring with clear pointers to the upstream are used.

All software development should follow common best practices.
At a minimum, the recommendations of the
[EURISE Network Technical Reference, {{ site.technical-reference.version }}]({{ site.technical-reference.url }})
must be followed.

To assess the fitness for CESSDA purposes, software systems must pass the [quality gate]({% link docs/software/quality_gate.md %}).

In certain cases, CESSDA can [archive source code repositories]({% link docs/software/code_archiving.md %})
of abandonded software development efforts.
