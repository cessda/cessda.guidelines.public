- Minimum standard - SML1

- Expected standard - SML3

- Excellent standard - SML5

*SML1 - Initial usability:* The software and software development
process comply, at least in part, with locally defined standards and
best practices. The standards may be internally or externally described,
but are implemented with modifications to meet local conditions. There
may be little or no documented evidence of standards used, but it may be
possible to infer this from the software consistency of functionality
and interfaces.

*SML2 - Use is feasible:* The software and software development process
endeavour to comply with recognised standards or widely used best
practices, but without verification or testing.
There is some documented evidence that standards are used, but it can not be verified.

*SML3 - Use is possible by most users:* The software and software
development process comply with open, recognised or proprietary
standards, but there is incomplete verification of compliance.
Compliance to recognised standards has been tested, but not for all components.

*SML4 - Software is usable:* The software and software development
process comply with open,recognised and/or proprietary standards.
Compliance with these standards has been verified through testing for all components.
Documented evidence for selected standards and verification through testing is available.

*SML5 - Demonstrable usability:* Compliance with open or internationally
recognised standards for the software and software development process,
is evident and documented, and verified through testing of all
components. Ideally independent verification is documented through
regular testing and certification from an independent group.
