The NASA RRL scale looks at the overall document suite, but it would be
both pragmatic and useful to break that down into three: end-user,
operational and development documents. That allows phased delivery (and
scoring) of documentation. A mean score can be calculated, if required -
e.g. in cases where only operational and development documentation are
required for acceptance.

- Minimum standard - SML2

- Expected standard - SML3

- Excellent standard - SML5

## CA1.1: End-user Documentation

*SML1 - Initial usability:* Partial or no external documentation
available; Documentation is insufficient to gain an understanding of the
functionality of the software even for an experienced user.

*SML2 - Use is feasible:* There is external documentation that is
accessible and sufficient for an expert user to configure and use the
software for the user's individual needs. Terminology and methodology is
not explained.

*SML3 - Use is possible by most users:* There is a user manual that can
guide a reasonably skilled user through use and customisation of the
software to the user's individual requirements. Terminology and methodology is
well explained. Documentation is
consistent with current version of the software.

*SML4 - Software is usable:* There are examples of walk-through
tutorials, how-to guides, demonstrations of various use case
customisations if needed for the user's individual needs. Documentation
is consistent with current version of the software.

*SML5 - Demonstrable usability:* User materials and tutorials can be
used as training resources. There is detailed in-software contextual
user support documentation. Documentation is consistent with current
version of the software. User created documentation and comments form
part of the documentation available.

## CA1.2: Operational Documentation

*SML1 - Initial usability:* Partial or no external documentation
available; Documentation is insufficient to gain an understanding for
the deployment and configuration of the software without additional
technical support or significant investment of time.

*SML2 - Use is feasible:* There is external documentation that is
accessible and sufficient for an expert to deploy and configure the
software for all users. Terminology and methodology is not fully
explained. Exception and failure messages are not fully explained.

*SML3 - Use is possible by most users:* There is a deployment and
configuration manual that can guide an experienced operational user
through deployment, management and configuration of the software.
Exception and failure messages are explained, but descriptions of
solutions are not available. Terminology and methodology is
fully explained. Documentation is consistent with current
version of the software.

*SML4 - Software is usable:* There are examples of walk-through
tutorials, demonstrations of various configurations. Exception
and failure messages are fully explained, and solutions are documented. Upgrade workflows are fully documented.
 Documentation is
consistent with current version of the software.

*SML5 - Demonstrable usability:* Documentation is appropriate for
different categories of deployment and management of the software.
Deployment and configuration demonstrations, materials and tutorials can
be used to teach other users. Documentation is consistent with current
version of the software. User created documentation and comments form
part of the documentation available.

## CA1.3: Development Documentation

*SML1 - Initial usability:* Partial or no external documentation
available of the application program interface (API). If available,  partial or
inconsistently commented source code. Documentation is insufficient to
gain an understanding of the software functionality without
significant investment of time.

*SML2 - Use is feasible:* There is external documentation that describes
public API functionality and is sufficient to be used by an experienced
developer. If available, source code is consistently and clearly
commented. Source code naming conventions are adhered to and consistent if available. 

*SML3 - Use is possible by most users:* There is external documentation
that describes all API functionality, human computer interface (HCI) and
code modules, which is sufficient to be used by any developer. THere is an
extension guide that provides information on how to customise and add plug-ins to the
software. Documentation of the source code (if available) is 
sufficient to allow an experienced developer to understand program flow
and logic with moderate effort.

*SML4 - Software is usable:* There is a guide to the documentation and
how to use it. There are examples of how to use the API & HCI for
different use cases, and materials & tutorials can be used to train
other developers. Documentation is consistent with current version of
the software.

*SML5 - Demonstrable usability:* All stages of the software development
lifecycle are fully documented, including design, testing and future
improvement planning. Documentation is appropriate for different
categories of users. Documentation is consistent with current version of
the software. User created documentation and comments form part of the
documentation available.
