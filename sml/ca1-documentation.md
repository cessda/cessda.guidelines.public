The NASA RRL scale looks at the overall document suite, but it is
both pragmatic and useful to break that down into three: end-user,
operational and development documents.
End-user documentation is considered to be part of the service-wrap
and is therefore excluded from this product-oriented collection.

- Minimum standard - SML2

- Expected standard - SML3

- Excellent standard - SML5

## CA1.1: Operational Documentation

*SML1 - Initial usability:* Partial or no external documentation
available; Documentation is insufficient to gain an understanding for
the deployment and configuration of the software without additional
technical support or significant investment of time.

*SML2 - Use is feasible:* There is external documentation that is
accessible and sufficient for an expert to deploy and configure the
software for all users. Terminology and methodology is not fully
explained. Exception and failure messages are not fully explained.

*SML3 - Use is possible by most users:* There is a deployment and
configuration manual that can guide an experienced operational user
through deployment, management and configuration of the software.
Exception and failure messages are explained, but descriptions of
solutions are not available. Terminology and methodology is
fully explained. Documentation is consistent with current
version of the software.

*SML4 - Software is usable:* There are examples of walk-through
tutorials and demonstrations of various configurations if applicable.
Exception and failure messages are fully explained, and solutions are documented.
Upgrade workflows are fully documented.
Documentation is consistent with the current version of the software.

*SML5 - Demonstrable usability:* Documentation is appropriate for
different categories of deployment and management of the software.
Deployment and configuration demonstrations, materials and tutorials can
be used to teach other users. Documentation is consistent with current
version of the software. User created documentation and comments form
part of the documentation available.

## CA1.2: Development Documentation

*SML1 - Initial usability:* Partial or no external documentation
is available for the application programming interface (API).
If available, the source code is partially or inconsistently commented.
Documentation is insufficient to gain an understanding of the software
functionality without a significant investment of time.

*SML2 - Use is feasible:* There is external documentation that describes
public API functionality and is sufficient to be used by an experienced
developer. If available, source code is consistently and clearly
commented and source code naming conventions are adhered to consistently.

*SML3 - Use is possible by most users:* There is external documentation
that describes all API functionality, human computer interface (HCI) and
code modules, which is sufficient to be used by any developer.
There is an extension guide that provides information on how to customise and add plug-ins to the software.
If available, source code documentation is sufficient to allow an experienced developer
to understand program flow and logic with moderate effort.

*SML4 - Software is usable:* There is a guide to the documentation and
how to use it. There are examples of how to use the API & HCI for
different use cases, and materials & tutorials can be used to train
other developers. Documentation is consistent with the current version of
the software.

*SML5 - Demonstrable usability:* All stages of the software development
lifecycle are fully documented, including design, testing and future
improvement planning.
Documentation is appropriate for different categories of users.
Documentation is consistent with the current version of the software.
User created documentation and comments form part of the available documentation.
