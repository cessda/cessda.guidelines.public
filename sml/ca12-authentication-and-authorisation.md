- Minimum standard - SML2

- Expected standard - SML3

- Excellent standard - SML5

*SML1 - Initial usability:* Single user mode, no fine-grained
authorisation.

*SML2 - Use is feasible:* Multiple users, no fine-grained authorisation
(i.e. all users have same role).

*SML3 - Use is possible by most users:* Multiple users, fine-grained
authorisation (i.e. users can have different roles).

*SML4 - Software is usable:* Authentication is externalised (e.g. via
social login, federated access management etc) and authorisation is
fine-grained (supporting groups and roles) and can be externalised (e.g.
via ldap).

*SML5 - Demonstrable usability:* Full rights management by users,
sharing/delegation of permissions/access to individual data from within
the system.
