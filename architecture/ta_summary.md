This document provides guidance for developers of components for the CESSDA Research Infrastructure (RI).
However, it does not aim to address all aspects at present, only those that are relevant to the current development tasks.
User Interface development guidelines are one of the deliberate omissions at this stage,
though a [style guide](https://zenodo.org/record/2631263) has been produced to help developers adopt a common look and feel.
It does provides guidance on meeting CESSDA's common interoperability characteristics, as they apply across the board.

It is envisaged that subsequent versions will address those areas that are needed by developers of the contemporary RI components,
so that feedback on their completeness and usefulness can be obtained in context.

It also lays out an approach for assessing the maturity of {% include glossary.html entry="RI" %} components,
so that over time CESSDA can mandate minimum levels that SPs and others have to meet as a prerequisite
to supplying software artefacts for the RI.
