This document provides guidance for developers of components for the CESSDA Research Infrastructure.
However, it does not aim to address all aspects at present, only those that are relevant to the current tranche of work plan tasks.
User Interface development guidelines are one of the deliberate omissions at this stage, as the current components are headless.
It does provides guidance on meeting CESSDA's common interoperability characteristics, as they apply across the board.

It is envisaged that subsequent versions will address those areas that are needed by developers of the contemporary RI components,
so that feedback on their completeness and usefulness can be obtained in context.

In the same way, deployment will be address in a later version, as and when the first components are ready to go into production.

It also lays out an approach for assessing the maturity of RI components,
so that over time CESSDA can mandate minimum levels that SPs and others have to meet as a prerequisite
to supplying software artefacts for the RI.
