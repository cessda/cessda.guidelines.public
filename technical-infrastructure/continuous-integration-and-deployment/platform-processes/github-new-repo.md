## Terminology

See [Naming Conventions]({% link technical-infrastructure/naming-conventions.md %}).

## Instructions for members of the Platform Team

Before doing anything, you must **log in to GitHub using an account that has administrative privileges**.

### First decide which GitHub organisation to put the repository in

* cessda - use for public repositories and repositories shared within the CESSDA Consortium (the vast majority of repositories are public, but deployment repositories are not)
* CESSDA-MO - use for private repositories that are not shared within the CESSDA Consortium (relating to things only the MO-IT teams needs to deal with)

### Clone the template

CESSDA code repository template (<https://github.com/cessda/cessda.code-repo.template> - private)

### Edit the boilerplate files

* `CHANGELOG.md`
* `CITATION.cif`
* `CONTRIBUTORS.md`
* `README.md`
