## Instructions for members of the Platform Team

Before doing anything, you must **log in to Github using an account that has administrative privileges**.

### First decide which Github organisation to put the repository in

* cessda - use for public repositories (the vast majority of repositories are public)

* CESSDA-MO - use for private repositories (relating to things only the MO-IT teams needs to deal with)

### Clone the template

[CESSDA code repository template](<https://github.com/cessda/cessda.code-repo.template/>)

### Edit the boilerplate files

* CHANGELOG.mg
* CITATION.cif
* CONTRIBUTORS.md
* README.md
