### CA12: Authentication and Authorisation

-   Minimum standard - SML2

-   Expected standard - SML3

-   Excellent standard - SML5

SML1 - Initial usability: Single user mode, no fine-grained
authorization.

SML2 - Use is feasible: Multiple users, no fine-grained authorization
(i.e. all users have same role).

SML3 - Use is possible by most users: Multiple users, fine-grained
authorization (i.e. users can have different roles).

SML4 - Software is usable: Authentication is externalised (e.g. via
social login, federated access management etc) and authorisation is
fine-grained (supporting groups and roles) and can be externalised (e.g.
via ldap).

SML5 - Demonstrable usability: Full rights management by users,
sharing/delegation of permissions/access to individual data from within
the system.
