# CA6: Portability

- Minimum standard - SML3

- Expected standard - SML4

- Excellent standard - SML5

*SML1 - Initial usability:* Porting to the target platform as a whole is
not feasible (e.g. due to licensing or dependencies not available for
the target platform) or prohibitively expensive.

*SML2 - Use is feasible:* The complete source code is available, without
external dependencies that are not portable, but the software cannot be
ported to the target platform without significant changes to the
software or the target context. Porting to the target platform will
require significant effort.

*SML3 - Use is possible by most users:* The software is moderately
portable to the target platform. The software can be ported with only
relatively small changes necessary to the context or the software
itself. Porting to the target platform would be relatively easy to
implement.

*SML4 - Software is usable:* The software is highly portable to the
target platform. No changes to the software are necessary and the effort
to port the software to the target platform is minimal.

*SML5 - Demonstrable usability:* The software is completely portable to
the target platform. In theory at least, the software will run on the
target platform provided it is packaged/containerised.
