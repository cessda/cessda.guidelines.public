# Versioning for CVS and ELSST

## CVS

* English is the main version, changing this increments major or minor
* Languages are derived from English
* *Any* change to a non-English language increments the patch version, and the version is applied to *all* translations

## ELSST

* Versioned by year of release
* Patches are done by appending a point version (i.e. 2022.2)
