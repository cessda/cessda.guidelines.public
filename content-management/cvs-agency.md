## Service Description and Main features

The CESSDA Vocabulary Service enables communities and organisations to create,
manage and publish their own vocabularies, thus enhancing data interoperability by
enabling users to search and download controlled vocabularies. The CESSDA Vocabulary Service
provides a discovery interface where vocabularies can be searched, browsed, and downloaded,
and an editing interface where vocabularies are managed, translated,
and versioned using persistent identifiers and citations.

## Community Response

Smaller organisations may face technical and resource constraints when hosting and managing their own vocabularies.
The CESSDA Vocabulary Service alleviates these challenges by providing a reliable and user-friendly
platform to host and manage vocabularies, making it easier for organisations to share and exchange
their controlled vocabularies with others.

## Licences and  Agreement

To use the CESSDA Vocabulary Service to create, manage and publish their own CVs, an organisation must
notify CESSDA ERIC by using the online form below, and agree to comply with the Privacy Policy,
Acceptable Use Policy, and Service Level Agreement provided by CESSDA.
